    <h3>This honey glazed halloumi is sliced, marinated in a tangy, flavorful honey sesame sauce, then browned quickly in a skillet. Greek in origin, and with a high melting point, this is classic fried halloumi with a twist.</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) block halloumi cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried minced garlic (such as McCormickÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>fresh lime wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice halloumi lengthwise into 6 equal slices and pat dry with a paper towel. Add halloumi slices to a shallow container</li>
        <li>For glaze, combine honey, sesame oil, lime juice, minced garlic, sesame seeds, and chili flakes in a small bowl. Spoon glaze over halloumi, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place halloumi in the pan, leaving plenty of space between slices. Cook until slices are a nice golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. They will brown quickly.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a simmer, add any remaining glaze to the skillet to quickly warm up. Spoon glaze over halloumi until well coated.</li>
        <li>Place halloumi slices on a plate with some fresh lime wedges, drizzle with any leftover glaze in the skillet, and serve immediately.</li>
